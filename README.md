# About

*EVE-Auth* is a PHP class which takes advantage of EVE's SSO (Single Sign-On) in order to authenticate a user without the hassle of having to store sensitive information.

In it's current state EVE-Auth is contained in a single file, however in the future i will release a version for composer and NPM.
